# Network-traffic-security-analysis
This project examines the traffic-handling and security differences between hubs and switches using Cisco Packet Tracer. It highlights how hubs broadcast packets to every connected device, while switches forward frames intelligently using MAC address learning. The project demonstrates why switches improve confidentiality, performance, and protection against packet sniffing.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate how hubs broadcast all packets to every connected device.
- Show how switches learn MAC addresses and forward frames intelligently.

  
- Demonstrate how hubs broadcast all packets to every connected device.
- Show how switches learn MAC addresses and forward frames intelligently.
- Analyze packet movement using Cisco Packet Tracer simulation mode.
- Explain cybersecurity implications such as packet sniffing risks.
- Introduce basic configurations including IP addressing and interface control.

- ## ⚡ Key Features
**Hub Behavior Analysis** 
- Broadcasts all traffic across the network
- No segmentation or filtering
- High vulnerability to sniffing attacks

**Switch Behavior Analysis**
- Learns MAC addresses dynamically
- Forwards frames only to their intended recipients
- Improves confidentiality and network performance

**Traffic Simulation**
- Visual packet flow analysis
- Event inspection using simulation mode
- MAC table verification for switching logic 

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Layer 2 Switch
- Hub
- Router (optional for extended configurations)
- Basic CLI commands in exec, privilege, and global configuration modes
